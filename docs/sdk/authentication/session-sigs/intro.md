# Session Signatures

:::note

`SessionSigs` are only available on Ethereum and are heavily in development, so things may change. Be sure to use the latest version of the Lit JS SDK.

:::

Session keys are a unique string of data generated during a specific online session between two or more entities. In our case, the keypair is a ed25519 keypair. It serves as a protective layer for identity verification by incorporating unique session-specific details such as date, time, and other contextual factors to generate a signature. A signature, known as a `SessionSig`, is obtained from the user through the session keys.

The Lit SDK uses the session keypair to sign all requests to the Lit Nodes. Each node in the Lit Network receives a unique signature for each request and can verify that the user owns the wallet address that signed the capability. The userâ€™s `AuthSig` is sent along with the `SessionSig` as an attached "capability" to introduce capability to the `SessionSig`.

Attaching capability is done by specifying the session keypair's public key as the `address` field of the `AuthSig` and the `capabilities` field. The `capabilities` field is an array of one or more signatures which authorize the `AuthSig` address (also our session keypair public key) to utilize the resources specified in the capabilities of the SIWE messages. These signatures contain the `AuthSig` `address` in their URI field, which can be seen in the example below.


## Capability Objects

Session signatures work by having scoped capabilities be granted to session keys by an inner `AuthSig`. The capability object is a [SIWE ReCap](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573) object.

Read more [here](capability-objects) on the session capability objects that we use.

## Format of `SessionSigs`

Given the following example `AuthSig`:

```json
{
    "sig": "0xef8f88fb285f006594637257034226923e3bbf7c6c69f8863be213e50a1c1d7f18124eefdc595b4f50a0e242e8e132c5078dc3c52bda55376ba314e08da862e21a",

Here is an example `SessionSig` that uses a session keypair to sign the `AuthSig` above:

}
```

<br/>

Here is what each field means:

- `sig` is the signature produced by the ed25519 keypair signing the `signedMessage` payload
- `derivedVia` should be `litSessionSignViaNacl` and specifies that the SessionSig object was created via the `NaCl` library.
- `signedMessage` is the payload that was signed by the session keypair.
- `address` is the session keypair public key.
- `algo` is the signing algorithm used to generate the session signature.

### Signed Message

Here is what each field in `signedMessage` means:

- `sessionKey` is the session keypair public key.
- `resourceAbilityRequests` is a lit of abilities that the session key is requesting to perform against the specified Lit resources during authentication. Read more [here](resources-and-abilities) about Lit Resources and Abilities.
- `capabilities` is an array of one or more AuthSigs.
- `issuedAt` is the time the SessionSig was issued.
- `expiration` is the time the SessionSig becomes invalid.
- `nodeAddress` is the specific URL the SessionSig is meant for.

#### Node Address

The `nodeAddress` will be different for each node, which means that, for a 30-node network, the SDK will generate 30 different `sig` and `signedMessage` parameters.
